# Interpolate-Session-


# interpolateSession

## Assignment

Write a function `interpolate` that replaces the declared variables inside of a string, enclosed within a left and right delimiter, with their respective values from the session object.
The function recieves three variables:

- a string `value`, which is the value to be interpolated,
- a `session` object, the object to retrieve variables from for interpolation,
- an `options` object, that takes
  - `leftDelimiter`: the delimiter on the left side of the variable
  - `rightDelimiter`: the delimiter on the right side of the variable

It returns the interpolated string.
